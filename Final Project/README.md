Experiment: Blind Spot
What does this experiment do?
- The experiment presents a fixation point in the middle of the screen, followed by a circle that appears at random locations on the screen.
- The stimuli are a fixation point (a small cross or dot) and a circle.
- The circle stimulus is presented for 1 second, and the participant must respond within this time by pressing a button on the keyboard.
- The participant's task is to indicate whether they saw the circle stimulus by pressing a button on the keyboard.
- The experiment records the participant's response (either "yes" or "no") and the reaction time (if the response was "yes").
- The reaction time and stimulus location data are saved to a CSV file, which can be easily analyzed and visualized using a spreadsheet program or other data analysis tools.
- This experiment is designed to detect potential blind spots in the participant's visual field by presenting a circle stimulus at random locations and measuring the participant's reaction time. By tracking the locations where the circle stimulus is presented and comparing them to the locations where the participant responds "yes", the experiment can identify areas where the participant consistently fails to see the stimulus, which may indicate a blind spot in that area.
