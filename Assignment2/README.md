Print exercises

2. no variables show up

Operation exercises
1. yes
2.it is a remainder operator that divides then gives u the remainder of the division
3.the ** is a exponent operator and the // divides then gives you a whole number rounded down or just remors the decimal
4.yes it does follow the order of operations 

Variable exercises

2. yes 9 variables are shown and they are all strings
3.there is repeated variables 
4. no python does not have a problem with having different variables for the same letter
5. no it did not change the other values

Boolean exercises

1. 1.0 and 1 are equal and '1' and '1.0' are not because one is a string and one is a equivalent int and float value and in order for a string to be equal it has to be the same thing.
2. yes it is equal
3. print(1 == 1.0 and not ("1" == "1.0")and 5 == (3+2))
print(1 == 1.0 and not ("1" == "1.0")or 5 == (3+2))
print(1 == 1.0 or "1" == "1.0" or 5 == (3+2))
print(1 == 1.0 and  "1" == "1.0" or 5 == (3+2))
print(1 == 1.0 or ("1" == "1.0")and 5 == (3+2))

List exercises

1. oddlist = [1,3,5,7,9] yes it became a variable
2. no error
3. 5
4. it says class list
5. intlist= list(range(1,100))
6. yes it does list out all numbers between 0-100

Dictionary exercises
about_me = {"name" : "abdiwahab", "age" : 20.0, "year of study" : 4, "favorite foods":["pizza","burgers",'pasta'] }
print(about_me)

Array exercises

1.it printed all of numbers as float numbers instead of ints

2. the array contained all strings python converted it to one data type

3. oddarray = np.array((list(range(1,100,2)))) or oddarray2=np.arange(1,100,2)

4. logarray=np.logspace(1,5,16)
